                Trivia
Steve Perry, former lead vocalist for Journey, has said that the Stranger Things season 4 remix of Journey's 1980s smash hit Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) was done pretty much the way he originally wanted it done in the 1980s, but lacked the technology. Steve was so impressed that he even helped with the development of the remix.

            <h2><em>Created by:</em> The Duffer Brothers</h2>
            <p>In a small town where everyone knows everyone, a peculiar incident starts a chain of events that leads to a child's disappearance, which begins to tear at the fabric of an otherwise-peaceful community. Dark government agencies and seemingly malevolent supernatural forces converge on the town, while a few of the locals begin to understand that more is going on than meets the eye.</p>
